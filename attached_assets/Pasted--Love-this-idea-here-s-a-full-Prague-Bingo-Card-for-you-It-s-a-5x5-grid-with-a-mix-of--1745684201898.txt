### Some extra notes to make it more fun:
- **Trdelník** is that rolled dough pastry — not *traditionally* Czech but super popular now.
- **Svíčková** = beef sirloin with cream sauce and dumplings — a Czech classic.
- **Becherovka** is an herbal liquor — strong, herbal, and you'll either love it or hate it.
- The **narrowest street** (Vinarna Certovka) even has a stoplight for pedestrians.
- **Beer Spa** = literally bathe in beer while drinking beer. Prague is wild like that.
- **Pilsner Urquell** is *the* classic Czech lager.
- Letná Park has some of the **best sunset views** of Prague's skyline over the river.
