## Database Schema

```typescript
// Key database tables with relationships

// Users table - stores user information and client IDs
export const users = pgTable("users", {
  id: serial("id").primaryKey(),
  username: text("username").unique(),
  clientId: text("client_id").unique(),
  currentCity: text("current_city"),
  createdAt: timestamp("created_at").defaultNow(),
});

// Cities table - stores city information and metadata
export const cities = pgTable("cities", {
  id: text("id").primaryKey(),
  title: text("title").notNull(),
  subtitle: text("subtitle"),
  styleGuide: jsonb("style_guide"),
  userId: integer("user_id").references(() => users.id),
  isCurrentCity: boolean("is_current_city").default(false),
  isDefaultCity: boolean("is_default_city").default(false),
  itemCount: integer("item_count").default(0),
  itemsWithDescriptions: integer("items_with_descriptions").default(0),
  itemsWithImages: integer("items_with_images").default(0),
  itemsWithValidImageFiles: integer("items_with_valid_image_files").default(0),
  lastMetadataUpdate: timestamp("last_metadata_update"),
});

// Bingo items table - stores activities for each city
export const bingoItems = pgTable("bingo_items", {
  id: text("id").primaryKey(),
  cityId: text("city_id").notNull().references(() => cities.id),
  text: text("text").notNull(),
  isCenterSpace: boolean("is_center_space").default(false),
  gridRow: integer("grid_row"),
  gridCol: integer("grid_col"),
  image: text("image"),
  description: text("description"),
});

// User completions table - tracks completed activities
export const userCompletions = pgTable("user_completions", {
  id: serial("id").primaryKey(),
  userId: integer("user_id").notNull().references(() => users.id),
  itemId: text("item_id").notNull().references(() => bingoItems.id),
  cityId: text("city_id").notNull().references(() => cities.id),
  completedAt: timestamp("completed_at").defaultNow(),
  userPhoto: text("user_photo"),
});
```

## Content Generation

### OpenAI Integration

The application leverages OpenAI's GPT and DALL-E models for content creation:

#### Text Generation Prompts

Here's an example of how bingo item descriptions are generated:

```javascript
// Prompt for generating descriptions
`You are an expert travel guide creating content for college students. 
Please write a short, informative description (2-3 sentences) for the activity: 
"${itemText}" in ${cityName}.

Focus on authentic local experiences, historical significance, and cultural context. 
Avoid overly touristy clich√©s and social media trends. 
Include practical tips and interesting facts that college students would appreciate. 
Keep it concise but engaging.`
```

#### Image Generation Prompts

Images are generated with city-specific style guides:

```javascript
// Prompt for generating images
`Create a high-quality square image of "${itemText}" in ${cityName}. 
Use the "${artStyle}" style (${styleKeywords}). 
Create a professional-quality image with no text, watermarks or borders. 
Emphasize visual clarity and authentic representation. 
Context: ${description}`
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Image File Management

Images are stored with a consistent naming pattern:
```
{cityId}bingo-{cityId}-{itemId}-{timestamp}-{uuid}.png
```

The system verifies image files during metadata updates by:
1. Reading the image path from the database
2. Checking for file existence in both `/public/images/` and `/public/` directories
3. Updating metadata counts when valid files are found

### User Identification

Users are identified via:
1. Client ID generation on first visit
2. Database storage of client-user mappings
3. Consistent state retrieval based on client identity

### Admin Batch Processing

For efficiency, the application supports batch operations:
1. Parallel image generation (5 images at once)
2. Bulk description generation
3. City metadata updating
4. Image repair and verification

## Troubleshooting

### Image Verification
If image counts in the admin dashboard don't match the actual files:

1. Use the `/api/update-city-metadata` endpoint to refresh metadata
2. Check `public/images/` for correct file storage
3. Verify database paths match actual file locations

### Content Moderation
Content generation may fail if it triggers OpenAI's content filters. For example, activities that reference:

- Nudity or explicit content
- Illegal activities
- Other content against OpenAI's usage policies

In these cases, rephrase the activity descriptions to avoid triggering filters.

## Conclusion

Travel Bingo represents a novel approach to tourism experiences, combining gamification with educational content to create a more engaging travel experience for college students. The application's modular design allows for easy expansion to new cities while maintaining a consistent user experience.

With AI-powered content generation and robust image management, the platform aims to inspire authentic exploration of global destinations through personalized challenges and contextual information.
